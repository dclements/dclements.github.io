A quiet, peaceful space that emphasizes the natural environment and the features of the land. We keep between six and ten horses (including some minis) on the property along with chickens and the occasional rented goat. They live in a paddock track system and stay in turnout most days, but there is a barn for horses that don’t thrive in that environment or who have specialized needs for feeding, grooming, or other care. There’s good pasture that we can use for enrichment and views but not grazing.Long Term Goals and Short Term ActionsSustainable PlantingBuilding and maintaining a good pasture, free of noxious weeds. Seeding twice a year with area-appropriate seeds. Plant roses along the edge of the property and around a labyrinth. Put natives up around the house and back yard. Minimize bare soil.Water Store manure well away from the local water supply (manure management plan). Ensure that herbicides are appropriate and safe for the area.Animals Find suitable shelter for moving more animals to property. Research options for dead animal disposal and make sure the numbers are posted along with vet and farrier information.

I knew this was coming, even in this term, and still I felt my entire body chill.The news is terrifying right now. Knowing that it is coming and seeing it in reality are always different things, and seeing the text of this opinion I thought of all of the people who will be hurt and how many lives with be affected when this decision goes into effect.Despair is a natural response, but I wanted to compile some thoughts from various sources on what people can actually do in this moment. What will be effective to do right now. It’s part of my way of coping, of understanding where I need to put my feet next and to understand how the situation has evolved over time.I don’t claim to have the answers, and I write this as much for myself as anyone. What I will say, however, is that the paths forward all involve organizing.Being Effective…stop engaging in parades, and start disrupting the operation of power.[2]Note first: Almost nothing here is effective unless you have done the ground level organizing, and that should almost always start with people who are already doing it, if they exist (and they often do).Breaking the LawDetermine if you are willing to break the law as part of your action, in what ways, and on what timeline. Think very careflly about this.Tonight‘s abject panic makes it clear that people aren’t ready for what’s about to happen. Get ready. Get your affairs in order. Figure out whether or not you’re willing to break the law to help a friend get an abortion and how far you’re willing to go. #RoeVWade&amp;mdash; ⚓️Imani Two-Kitchens Gandy⚓️ (@AngryBlackLady) May 3, 2022If you haven’t already then talk this position over with your family and be prepared to make some hard choices in the future here. Think about it, think about what you are willing to do, and think about the consequences you are willing to endure. Especially if you come from a place of privilege, meaning that for you such thinking is unusual, spend some serious time with the question of where you land on this.Remember:You law abiding citizens, come listen to this songLaws were made by people, and people can be wrongOnce unions were against the law, but slavery was fineWomen were denied the vote and children worked the mineThe more you study history the less you can deny itA rotten law stays on the books til folks like us defy it[3]I do not, here, mean “talk about what other people should do.” This is about your position. Then talk to others who have already been working on this problem.Understand Where You LiveWith the repeal of Roe, we will get to a hodgepodge of laws through the US (At least until the Republicans gain control of the House, Senate, and Presidency again).For example, in Colorado there is the Reproductive Health Equity Act in force, a blue general assembly, a blue governor.Broadly, States fall into one of four categories (borrowing from the Center for Reproductive Rights): Welcoming. Places with strong protections (constitutional or statutory) and few restrictions. Protected. They lack the stronger protections or maybe have some additional restrictions, but safe abortions are readily available and likely to remain so. Not protected. Places where it is only grudgingly legal, but which lack enjoined laws or so-called “trigger laws.” Hostile. Active antagonism with trigger laws or enjoined laws that will go into force almost immediately.But the details matter and there’s tremendous state level variance even within each of the categories. As a result you will often find different groups will rate places differently at the edges depending on how much, e.g., they look at TRAP laws or whether they consider a court decision binding.Fundamentally, there are four states (and DC) that protect abortion throughout the pregnancy. There are sixteen states that protect it up to the point of viability. Some of those are statutory protections, some of them are constitutional protections, and sometimes they have other restrictions (like TRAP laws) even though it is generally legal.Other states are a mixed bag. Some are outright hostile in a lot of ways, but it will remain at least somewhat available so long as the current balance of power in their local government remains where it is.Know where you are. Know the status of your neighboring states. Know the status of where your friends live. The laws here are a hodgepodge and knowing where your state falls and the specifics of where it falls is important. Some states aren’t likely to restrict it, but also won’t necessarily be good states to drive a friend to either.Good sources here are the Center for Reproductive Rights, the Guttmacher institute, and Rewire news group.Know which is which. Especially as you start working with groups that have been doing this already, it will help give you a baseline understanding of what you are up against.Organize for direct actionI don’t mean parades (what people often call protests).Organize your workplace, your community, your apartment complex. Get them radicalized and start thinking about what direct action would look like for your group. Start building resources for mutual aid.What you fight for and how you fight with this depends on what you have organized, but some examples: Get “will not discriminate on the basis of having had an abortion” or equivalent language added to your union contract or tenant agreement. Unions need to start looking at expanding language on preventing employees from getting fired for getting abortions, now.&amp;mdash; C.M. Lewis (@thehousered) May 3, 2022 Push your company and your union to vocally support abortion access. Get your company to support paying travel expenses for those who have to travel for abortions. Shut down businesses that do discriminate here. Your local coffee shop fired someone for getting an abortion? Sit in. Fill every table, lock hands and keep people from entering, turn them into a local pariah. Push companies to stop supporting republican politicians. Make companies that don’t do this miserable. Make life miserable for your local legislators (or the US congress or SCOTUS, I won’t judge). Keep pressure up on them. Use your mutual aid funds to help people get abortions or organize driving/flying people between states. Come up with other goals that you can reach with various forms of direct action. Get creative and talk it over with your peers, because what you can do is far more expansive than you likely realize.On that note: You can only organize where you are involved. You can’t organize effectively from the outside, so don’t try to “organize the south” unless you live there.Most of these require that you organize to be effective, so start there. Focus on your apartment complex, your school, your job, your communities. If you are working with organizers of other groups, your job is to listen to them and give them what they ask for.One thing I was told very early in union organizing is that it doesn’t matter if your coworkers are conservative, if they think they are anti-union, whatever else. They can still be organized.Ultimately remember though: Direct action is a tool, and as Sara Nelson says, our power comes from solidarity. [4] The Black Panthers are known for escorting people to register to vote with guns, but they also made breakfast for children, which is also a form of direct action. Conversely, the Provisional IRA had massive support from the community, for example in the rattling of trash bin lids to signal raids. [5]Donate money and time to groups that are already working on these problemsTry really hard to not reinvent the wheel.When you are looking to do something, look for people who are already doing that job and help them. Don’t try to create things de novo, focus instead on supporting what already exists.Usually when people in dominant cultures first become aware of a problem there’s a group that has been working on that exact problem for over 100 years. This is no different.The first step there is learn who is already working on these problems. Then you can listen to what they need and give it to them.Political ApproachesPolitical approaches fall under the category of “don’t put faith in our systems, our systems are at best broken and at worst working exceptionally well at being terrilbe,” but political approaches can create a lot of buffer. Fighting a group of incompetent Democrats who can’t agree is night-and-day from fighting a group of fascist Republicans. Fighting to protect your rights when you have a state-level constitutional amendment in hand is very different than fighting to protect your rights when you don’t have such passed.So these are effective approaches in some ways, but don’t depend on the government or the political parties to save us. Only we can do that, and many of these are–like the elements above–only effective with good organizing.Push Local Government AroundThe difference between living in Colorado and living in Texas on these sorts of issues is night and day. So get your local government to pass protections.Call your city council, your mayor, your local legislator, your local governor.Make them pledge to pass laws to protect abortion in your state or to provide some degree of sanctuary in your city. Primary them if they won’t do it. If they are all about StAtEs RiGhTs tell them “great, you now have the right to make it legal.” Push them to resist national legislation banning it.Referendums and Citizen InitiativesGo through whatever your state’s public referendum or citizen’s initiative process is for adding or challenging a constitutional amendment or a law. Learn what your state does for this and what it requires and get on it, and use it to either strike down legislative overreach or to enshrine protections.Remember that abortion protections up to at least some point are popular in the US, so even if you can’t get your legislators on board you can still get protections passed locally.If you already have it protected, try to amplify those protections. Get it as a constitutional amendment if it isn’t already protected there, make it as explicit an amendment as possible.Push your national legislatorsThis doesn’t mean yelling “DO SOMETHING” on twitter. Call them. Every day. Fax things to them. Show up at townhalls and yell at them. Chase them into bathrooms. Camp out in front of their office or their house. Confront them in restaurants. Make your displeasure clear.They are there to serve you. Remind them of that fact.Tell them to pass the House’s protection. Tell them to expand the SCOTUS. Tell them to push the President to send abortion providers to federal lands and other suggestions that people like Elie Mystal and Imani Gandy have been talking about.Do this even if they are conservatives. Make them so miserable that they leave.Vote. Blue.Vote and vote blue. Every time. Regardless if they have earned it. Make it so that Manchin is the most conservative member of a 60 member senate. Make sure that the Democrats keep the Presidency. Take your local governorship. Take your local legislator. Take your local dogcatcher and make it blue.If you don’t want a particular Democrat in the role then primary them, then vote for the Democrat who wins the primary.Voting blue is insufficient. It is woefully inadequate. Electoralism will not save us. But it belongs on this list because you don’t want to be trying to do any of these with a GOP congress and a GOP president, we want to replace Supreme Court members with people who are sympathetic in the long run, not fascists, and a hodgepodge is better than a nationwide ban passed by and enforced by fascists.The republicans are fascists. Keep them out of power.On thate note, it is also important to do the work to improve access to voting. Make sure everyone is registered to vote. Make sure that they can vote. Protect them in trying to vote. Help them make sure they remain registered to vote and are eligible to vote. Improve turnout in disadvantaged communities with whatever that takes.I do, incidentally, mean “whatever that takes.”Don’t Reinvent the Wheel, Don’t Give UpTo begin, welcome to the repro world. I&amp;#39;ve been an abortion fund volunteer for six years and can confidently say that we&amp;#39;ve seen this coming. We have prepared for this moment for years and are grounded in reality but nimble enough to evolve with these devastating changes. /1&amp;mdash; Sarah (@the_sar_bear88) May 6, 2022White leftists in particular have a long habit of noticing something and coming to three conclusions: That because they haven’t heard of it previously, no one else has either. That any other groups that have been working on this have not succeeded due to failures of vision, ethics, or because they haven’t had the white person’s unique insight. That because something turns out to be hard, it is intractable.It took over a century in the US to stop some of the worst excesses of child labor and we’re still not done nearly a century after that. Women’s suffrage was similarly over 80 years in the making. Let alone the distance between 1619 and 1865.There are often groups already doing a lot of the things that people think of, saw this coming, and have deep knowledge of the terrain. Connect with them! Help them as much as possible. Remember that we have to be in this for the long haul.Conclusions: Consider Where You Are, and Where You Need To BeIn every case, think in terms of where you are, what you want to accomplish and drawing a line to what it will take to accomplish that, and what your escalation is if you fail. As the quote from Gen. Robert H. Barrow goes:Amateurs talk about strategy and tactics. Professionals talk about logistics and sustainability in warfare.This means that you can’t just go “we’re going to have a general strike!” then later go “well, no one showed up, so our solution is ADVERTISE HARDER.”Where you are: Be realistic. Do you have the solidarity and support for a strike? For a general strike? For a sit-in? If not, what will it take to get to that point? How are you going to manage this without burning everyone out?We must maintain hope and certainty that we will win, and we also must maintain a clear-eyed realization of what our position is.What you are trying to accomplish and what it will take to accomplish that: If you want to, say, raise the minimum wage for everyone, having a walkout at your local whole foods is unlikely to accomplish that. Your escalation if you can’t secure a 15 dollar minimum wage is not “ask for 25 dollars instead” and your escalation path if you can’t get your local store to strike is not “we’ll have a general strike instead!”Your escalation path should be clear and you should have one, but that means being realistic about where you are and what you can do right now with the resources that you have. It means understanding where you are logistically, and how that situation will evolve.Learn constantly. Be prepared to fail and to learn from your failures. Be prepared for this to take not just years but generations.After all, it took generations to get here.References[1] &amp;nbsp; J. Gerstein and A.

This is a memory about how it got replaced with dependency injection.I put “service locator” in quotes because a normal service locator pattern looks something like this:ClassAServiceLocatorlocate(ServiceKey&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;) : Service&amp;lt;T extends Service&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt;ServiceT extends Service&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;initialize()serviceState(): ServiceStateService01Service01Service02Service02May be a service or just an unencapsulated class.1*Then in order to locate a service, you just pass the service key to the locator:ClassAService LocatorServicealt[Not Ready]locate(ServiceKey&amp;lt;Service&amp;gt;)checkIfReadycreate()new(Service)initialize()ready()ServiceClassAService LocatorServiceWhen services depend on each other you try to keep it out of the initialize step, or at a minimum keep it as a directed acyclic graph inside the initialize step so that they won’t deadlock.This is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike what this system did.The System’s DesignWhile the system was clearly inspired by a service locator pattern, in an effort to make it “type safe” it had made certain allowances in its design:ClassAClassBClassCRootclassA(): List&amp;lt;ClassA&amp;gt;classB(): ClassBclassC(): ClassC10..*1111Initialization happened entirely in the constructor and with interdependencies between the classes:ServerRootClassAClassBClassCcons()cons()classAcons()classA()classAdoSomething()classBcons()classA()classAdoSomething()classB()classBdoSomethingElse()doAnotherThing()finishAnotherThingresultsFromSomethingElseclassCrootServerRootClassAClassBClassCServices could (and did) refer to other services outside of their constructors, which may or may not be initialized. These methods would be called by other services inside their constructors.Among other consequences: It meant that the order that the services were created in the constructor was extremely fragile. You had no ability to know, when you added a new call to an item, if it had any dependencies that were unresolved. It was completely untestable and it made new code difficult to test. This was made worse by the constructors engaging in behavior like File IO or starting threads.This company at the time was very anti-testing for a variety of reasons, but part of it was that writing tests with a system like this led to brittle tests that were difficult to write and provided minimal value.Purpose of the DesignThe (unfulfilled) idea was that you could have various types of system all living together not just in one code base, but one binary and spin up a server with radically different characteristics through configuration alone.This was never followed through with, but it did mean that a lot of Root code would end up in sometimes bizarre tools that really didn’t need to be running, say, the production user management system.This was not something that anyone really wanted to keep: it was a vision that never came to fruition, and no one really thought it would ever come to be, but a lot of the design choices were predicated on this assumption.So I Set Out To Fix ItFixing this “service locator” became a major focus for me. I wanted to convert us to dependency injection model and had chosen guice as a framework. Guice had several advantages over other systems: It required no mucking about with the build, which at that point was something incredibly perilous to change (another team was working on this problem). It had support for a lot of weird edge cases, such as multibinding, circular dependencies, and things of that nature. These aren’t necessarily desireable, but they were already extant in the code and we didn’t know where all of them were. It worked off the standard JSR injection patterns, which facilitate doing manual injection and make testing easier.I got a few people together who were on board, got buy-in from different parts of the org, and off we went.Can we start from the bottom up?The original idea was to start at the bottom and work my way up:Find a point with no dependencies (that aren&#39;t injected)Replace it with the injectorInitialize complex behavior in an initialize() methodWhere possible, it would also help to bring pieces into a test harness, even if we couldn’t write any tests for them yet.This approach, which focused on the degree of coupling, had several advantages: Minimally Invasive By starting with the lowest pieces of the puzzle and working up meant that, especially at first, the components did not need excess dependencies and the modules could be kept relatively simple. Also it meant that each individual code change would be small and would be unlikely to impact anyone who wasn’t working on that exact class. Fast Benefit It could be done in small pieces—two hours here, a day there—rather than requiring a large amount of work up front. Isolated Most of the classes that fit this description were not in the critical path per se, or were in the critical path but their instantiation and teardown were not in the crtitical path. This meant that we could make the changes without radically altering the performance or memory characteristics of the system so that we could prove that we wouldn’t impact things too badly before moving to the more critical path components.The limitations, however, quickly became apparant as well: Because of the mass of interrelated dependencies, we ended up needing multiple injectors that we would build on in later steps. It turns out that the criteria for this actually came out to very few cases. Adding additional cases got more and more difficult, particularly as we started encountering classes with 15+ dependencies. It was actually fairly difficult to map how many dependencies a given class had. Because of the problem of A would call B during the instantiation process of C, and because there was a lot of code that would do: root.getA().getB().getC().doSomething() finding which class to pick next was relatively challenging.But the real kicker was this: People who were doing development would often reach for a tool that was on Root but then get confused on “how to add it the right way.” They would add dependencies that were not ready to be brought in, and this meant that the entire class would need to be revisited.This also meant that rather than doing dependency injection, a lot of classes would end up with a hodgepodge of dependency injection and service lookups… and we were inadvertantly encouraging them to make more of a hodgepodge going forward rather than encouraging other developers to clean things up.We had created a situation where there were pretty much two people who could actually improve the health of the code and drive the project forward.This was, suffice it to say, undesireable.Enter Project Root CanalInstead of going at it from the bottom up, what if we went at it from the top down? Focusing on the order of initialization rather than the degree of coupling.Basically:Find a point with no (uninjected) initialized dependenciesConvert it entirely to dependency injectionInitialize complex behavior in an initialize() methodThis also gave us an opportunity, because most of these needed to be initialized, to wrap a lot of the tooling in Guava services, which gave us better error handling and lifecycle management.Dependencies that were not ready to be converted to DI wholesale could still inject Root and use that object, giving a stopgap measure to keep us from having to convert the entire system in one throw.Basically: Rather than start at the bottom and work our way up, we were starting at the top and working our way down. Rather than attempting to eliminate the Root object per se, we were hollowing it out and turning it into a wrapper for the initialization.The outer structure of Root would remain exactly the same, but the inner structure of it became something simpler.Having decided on a course of action, the initial work to get the basic framework in place took around two weeks. This kicked off the iterative process–which took months–of moving every component over to the new system.Making it ReadableGuice has a reputation for making code hard to read. This is especially true when it is used in highly complex ways, with architectures that involve lots of options in their module configurations (what is Foo bound to? who can say!). We adopted several principles in this design to make sure that we didn’t end up in a worse position than where we started: Every package should contain exactly one (1) public module. No bindings should reach outside of their module if it is possible to avoid it (no impl packages). There was some flexibility on this point for multibindings. By convention this public module was named &amp;lt;Package&amp;gt;Module. Every package was responsible, within its public module, for injecting the modules of child packages. There were a handful of exceptions to this, but we tried to make them as explicit as possible. What this meant was that, combined with (1), even if the classes had dependencies all over the place, the modules would form a tree that was identical to the package hierarchy. Modules should contain no conditional logic, with only a handful of exceptions. Everything should be as explicit as possible: no implicit bindings, always use @Inject on constructors, and try to follow the Law of Demeter [1]. All binding logic should be inside of the modules and their associated Providers. No using @ImplementedBy or @ProvidedBy.The goal here was to simplify what we could in guice and make it as simple as possible to find and diagnose problems. You should never have to wonder “where was this bound.” If you wanted to know the implementation for com.example.foo.Bar you looked for com.example.foo.FooModule as a starting point, and you knew it had to be bound somewhere within a Module inside of com.example.foo. This limited the search scope to a handful of classes, usually only one or two.Using these rules, you could pretty much always find the implementation of a given object with grep or by hand, if need be.It also simplified reasoning about the module layout if you always knew that com.example.foo.FooModule would always inject com.example.foo.bar.BarModule and com.example.foo.baz.BazModule.Getting Others On BoardThere’s a lot more to making a change of this scale and scope than just the technical work of migrating the code. A lot of other things had to start happening simultaneously, and ultimately the success of a project like this depends on more than a small group working on it. We needed to get everyone to join in on the process.Many of the developers had started their careers with this system and only had peripheral knowledge of dependency injection as a set of principles. This necessitated a lot of different approaches to try to make sure that the ideas were widely disseminated: Holding small group workshops with practice and discussion elements. Larger sessions that were more theory focused. Providing resources in the form of books, articles, and the like. One-on-one work with individuals, especially with help debugging or tracking down problems. Copious code reviews.It also required clearing up some misconceptions: That “dependency injection” is a framework. Essentially thinking that DI = Spring, Guice, Dagger, etc. That merely being instantiated with guice would significantly alter the runtime performance characteristics. That this was the end of the journey and after this we would be in a magical place.Now for the Test HarnessMeanwhile, a senior SDET had been working on trying to get the entire thing into an integration test harness that could run against a known database.To do this, we made sure that there were tools in place that allowed them to swap out the injector in test and we prioritized those pieces that did things that were really undesireable in a testing situation. Things like interacting with a database or opening a network socket inside of a constructor. As much as possile we tried to move these into guava services that we could initialize separately from their construction.Now whenever someone would instantiate the service, a series of steps took place that most programmers never had to worry about or deal with:Build the set of moduleswe were going to useCreate the guice injectorInject the ServiceManagerStart the ServiceManagerWait for the ServiceManager toreach a healthy stateWith that done we could add a few static methods that allowed us to swap out the modules and we were good to go.Well, AlmostTurns out that people have a strong reflex when they see a class that looks like this:Foo(Root root) { this.root = root;}Become this:@InjectFoo( DependencyA a, DependencyB b, DependencyC c, DependencyD d, //12 more dependencies DependencyQ q) { // ...}They have some understandable twitch reactions and second thoughts.The thing was that, by and large, those dependencies were preexisting. It’s just that previously they happened deeper in the code when root.getQ() was called. It wasn’t adding dependencies, instead it was revealing the dependencies that already existed.Refinements and IterationsThrough this we had several missteps or learning experiences along the way that caused reevaluation and backtracking or doing things differently.Multiple InjectorsOur early efforts involved building multiple, chained injectors. This was done because fo the early design philosophy of starting at the bottom and working our way up, as we often had to deal with situations where a (non-injected) object needed to use the result of injection before something else (that was injected) could be built.CreateSomeObjectsOriginalInjectorcreateInjectorfirstServiceStartCreateMoreObjectsSecondInjectorcreateChildInjector1randomServiceStartCreateAnotherObjectGroupThirdInjectorcreateChildInjector2otherServiceStartCreateEvenMoreObjectsfinalServiceGroupThis proved to be moderately disastrous as an approach: This made it extremely difficult to test. The construction process become fragile and any change to ordering or system construction would cause the test harness to break. Because some steps depended on the initialization of previous steps, it meant that you almost couldn’t use a ServiceManager and were instead stuck with initializing every service manually. It became very difficult for engineers who weren’t extremely familiar with the ins and outs of guice to modify the system in any way, which was the opposite of what was desired.PrivateModuleWhen we first started, we used PrivateModules to strictly segment the code areas. This way the packages very rarely impacted each other. Over time, it was recognized that this was not ideal. PrivateModule did not work with a lot of the tooling that makes it easier to debug, visualize, or test guice. It ended up making it harder to share certain key, central resources that were already shared. It became challenging to know whether it was more appropriate to declare a resource in the private module or in a higher level module, or to find resources that might be useful that had already been bound somewhere. It added another layer of conceptual complexity to an already complex system.In the end, we did away with virtually all of the private modules, moving instead to binding annotations/qualifiers instead.Testing Moving Ahead of RefactoringIn several cases testing moved ahead of refactoring, requiring us to break and fix a large body of tests that had been written to try to solve the incredibly weird problem. This was especially true when we had started from the bottom up, but it remained a problem until we had finalized the changes.Luckily, the testing group was completey on board with our work, so it made it an easy sell in a lot of ways, but it still meant there was some avoidable churn in how we went about it.Is That a Singleton?Guice likes to deemphasize the use of singletons—for good reasons—when they aren’t absolutely required. This had… odd interfacing with some of the elements of the system that depended on something being a singleton and never documented it.This was particularly challenging for sets of objects that depended on shared locks (yes, this was a thing), where the object had some slow memory leak that hadn’t been previously detected, or where a singleton was being used as a memory control. In these cases there was no obvious reason why a singleton was the right choice–and sometimes it was in fact the wrong choice–but Bad Things™ would happen from removing that conceit from the system.This was also challenging because a lot of bugs could crop up that were very subtle as a result of these sorts of conceits. To catch these we had to do a lot of work with load testing, because the problems would only manifest under load.ConclusionUltimately the project was what I’d term successful: we got the system into a stable, testable, state. It was in many waySo that’s me getting the story of how we tore apart the central conceit of a system out of my system.References[1] &amp;nbsp; K. J. Lieberherr, I. Holland, and A. J.

They will circulate this message widely and make it seem like “the way to support the union.”But in truth these efforts can actually do serious damage to the actual organizing.Types of BoycottsThere are essentially four broad categories of things that often get called boycotts (there are other models, but this is one that I like): Consumer Boycotts Solidarity Boycotts Symbolic Boycotts Moral PurchasingAll four of these get called “boycotts” but in truth refer to three very different things. What it comes down to is “what are you trying to accomplish” and “with what power.”Sometimes things also involve elements of multiple types, but that could be another essay.Consumer BoycottsWhen a man takes a farm from which another has been evicted, you must shun him on the roadside when you meet him – you must shun him in the streets of the town – you must shun him in the shop – you must shun him on the fair green and in the market place, and even in the place of worship, by leaving him alone, by putting him in moral Coventry, by isolating him from the rest of the country, as if he were the leper of old – you must show him your detestation of the crime he committed. [Charles Parnell at Ennis in County Claire, which became the foundation of pressure method on Charles Boycott][1, Pp. 119-120]A consumer boycott is the “classical” model of a boycott where a group of consumers organize to not engage with a business or set of businesses so long as some state or condition holds true.There are variations, but the basic form is: Find people who are consumers of the product Get them to agree to not purchase the product until after a situation is resolved Keep up the pressure and continue to organize until the company relents Resume normal purchasing behavior once victory is wonFor example, there have been a few successful boycott campaigns around advertising on some show or another. These work by looking for advertisers on the show and getting a group of people who might normally buy those products—regardless of whether they watch the show in question—and promise to not purchase until after they stop advertising.[2]Another example of this is when Nestlé advertised their infant formula as “better than breastmilk” in the 1970s. A worldwide boycott ensued and only ended when they agreed to comply with guidelines on advertising from the WHO.Campaigns like this depend on people who are purchasing the product withholding their purchases for a period of time until the boycott has ended. Building a consumer boycott requires finding people who use the service or buy the product and convincing them on a short-term good to pressure the company in question.I can’t boycott men’s soccer because I don’t watch men’s soccer and am not going to start pretty much no matter what they do. This form of a boycott relies on consumer purchasing power, and if I’m not willing to purchase the product even if things change, then I can’t exactly threaten them by removing what I am already not giving them. If I wanted to build a boycott to pressure them, I would have to find a way to convince people who are true fans of men’s soccer, not just people like me.Solidarity BoycottsSolidarity boycotts are where you act at the behest of the workers and refrain from purchasing a product at their request. Usually while they are striking.Thank you for your support! This is a great map of #GroceryStores in Denver that don&amp;#39;t have a strike at them. Stand in solidarity, don&amp;#39;t shop at @MyKingSoopers https://t.co/ZRXjmpVVMg&amp;mdash; UFCW Local 7 (@UFCW_7) January 14, 2022The idea here is that you are amplifying the union’s power: by not purchasing, you are demonstrating to the company that the union has teeth and that failure to acquiese will be disasterous to the company.There have been many successful solidarity boycotts. Both primary boycotts (boycotting a grocery store because the workers are striking over their working conditions) and secondary boycotts (boycotting a grocery store because they sell, e.g., grapes and the grape workers are striking over their working conditions).But it isn’t always the right strategy. A boycott is an escalation, something that unions want to keep in their pocket but which jumping to right off the bat means that they don’t have that escalation tool for later. There are even some situations where not purchasing when you normally would can act like a scab by reducing the amount of work that needs to get done. It is difficult to know for sure unless you work at the company, and so it works best to listen to guidance of their union to know what to do.Sometimes it is also more nuanced than simply “don’t buy”:Support Nabisco workers on strike! BOYCOTT Made-in-Mexico Nabisco!#checkthelabel #fightforamericanjobs #boycottmadeinmexiconabisco pic.twitter.com/EnYzf28Kvl&amp;mdash; BCTGM International (@BCTGM) August 12, 2021It should go without saying that you aren’t supporting the workers if you do this of your own volition, and boycotting without the union’s request can seriously hurt their organizing efforts.Symbolic BoycottsIt’s more “symbolic than substantial,” but that doesn’t mean it’s consequence-free.[3]A lot of boycotts the intent is not to actually put any pressure at all on the company per se, or perhaps only indirect pressure for the future. The goal of such is to get people activated about some other issue. By calling for a boycott the hope is that they will raise awareness about that issue and bring focus onto something that is being neglected.Mostly symbolic strikes are good for something other than applying pressure to a company: Bringing public attention on a much ignored issue. Often one that is shared between groups. They can be used by unions for structure testing, but for the most part their goals aren’t about worker power, they are about shining a light in the darkness.In this way of thinking, #BoycottMulan wasn’t about Mulan at all. Not really.It was about Hong Kong.The point was not reducing support for Mulan. The point wasn’t to make Mulan crash. The point wasn’t to put screws into Disney or make Disney change their behavior (though if they made it sufficiently uncomfortable for them that was a nice perk). The point wasn’t what the actress said specifically or why she said it. The point was that China’s treatment of HK is reprehensible, and what the actress said and what happened was a vehicle to shine a light on it. That doesn’t mean that what she was was remotely okay, but it also means that the reason why she said it is kind of irrelevant: It doesn’t matter if she must say things like that to be successful in China, because the point isn’t about her, or Disney per se, it’s about China.I’m not asking you to boycott this series so much as I’m asking you to CARE ABOUT GENOCIDE.&amp;mdash; Jeannette Ng 吳志麗 (@jeannette_ng) September 3, 2020Similarly, Cixin Liu’s comments and fame are being used, via calls to boycott Three Body Problem, to bring attention to the genocide happening right now, right this second. It doesn’t matter why he said it, that’s not the point. The problem is that not enough people are aware of the attrocity happening.With symbolic boycotts it often isn’t relevant if you ultimately end up seeing it, reading it, etc. Because the goal was much greater.Moral PurchasingThe way we spend our money can help to change the world.[4]Moral purchasing—typified by movements and groups such as Ethical Consumer—is not attempting to influence corporate behavior so much as individual behavior. Moral purchasing is often conflated with a boycott but is something else entirely: an attempt to make the most moral choices possible given the capitalist dystopia.For example, a lot of people in the 70s and 80s started avoiding veal due to the success of several anti-veal campaigns.To the extent that these can be cosidered “boycotts” they are qualitatively different from consumer boycotts: the goal is not to get back to eating veal (or meat) and the companies that produce veal are not being boycott (usually). By spending money and/or putting attention on “more ethical” causes, the goal is to shape the world accordingly.Supporting UnionsA lot of people like to insert their own views about what “should” support a union, or they want to “show solidarity” with a union and so they reach for the tool they have seen used in the past: the boycott.Sometimes they’ll even put the union logo or branding onto it, making it to all perspectives as if it is actually coming from the union.This came up pronouncedly when a group of people decided to “boycott Amazon” during a union drive. Which was exactly the wrong time to be doing such:&quot;A boycott like this really just plays into management’s hands by giving ammunition to the idea that this is going to be about conflict all the time and that you’re going to have outside people interfering in your life, which isn’t what a union is,&quot; said Connor Lewis, editor for the labor publication Strikewave.[5]This also came up during the IATSE strike authorization:Strike strategy is all about building to a crisis for the employer. Most (if not all) strike strategies and plans include a series of escalations before and after a strike.&amp;mdash; Stefanie Frey (@stef_frey_) October 16, 2021It is incredibly important to listen to the union in these situations. Not just individual members—who do not speak for the union as a whole—but to the union itself. You aren’t helping the union if you aren’t doing what they ask and are speaking over them.The idea of “consumers should never cross a picket line” is a good starting point, but it is just that: a starting point. When there is no picket line then you aren’t “crossing the picket line” to go to a company.Another variation in the “speaking over the union” is when people insert their own views over what the union is promoting. For example, a relativley common pattern is something like: There’s a call by a union to, e.g., boycott Apple. Someone says in response “Yes! Never buy Apple products! They are anti-consumer!”Regardless of your position on Apple’s market position, this is speaking over the workers. It isn’t doing what the union has requested, it is substituting your own agenda for theirs.This isn’t to say that you should purchase from Apple, or Amazon, or whoever if that doesn’t fit within your morals. That is instead to say that you aren’t supporting the union by telling people “never purchase” when the request is not that.Similarly, it is important to communicate within the domain of the requested action. So if the request is “don’t buy made-in-Mexico Nabisco products” then the request isn’t “don’t buy Nabisco products” without qualifier.It’s really incredibly frustrating to see eight million twitter messages that all read “BOYCOTT TO SUPPORT THE UNION” and calling people “scabs” if they don’t when there was no request to boycott and the union does have specific requests that aren’t being shared.It sucks the air out of the room.ConclusionThis is a basic rundown of how I think and talk about types of boycotts. Some main takeaways: Not all things that are called boycotts are actually boycotts. The moral calculus on breaking ranks varies with the circumstances. Not participating in a symbolic boycott is a very different situation from not participating in a solidarity boycott, but also the infrastructure of support looks very different. In a symbolic boycott there is very rarely any infrastructure to support people who might be impacted, in a solidarity boycott you can often find resources and guides to help obviate the pain, at least for a little while. Listen to the organizers on the ground. You don’t have to agree with them, but they are usually the ones with the most context and understanding, so let them lead.References[1] &amp;nbsp; T. E.

It’s a game where you try to guess a word in six tries, with it letting you know, at each guess: Which letters you get in the correct position Which letters appear in the word but are in the incorrect position Which letters do not appear in the wordIn a real way, each guess you take with wordle is a theory where you are trying to figure out what words it can’t be. From the start, you have no information with which to make a guess, with each guess you gain more information, so the best strategy is often to focus on eliminating as many words as possible.For the first few guesses especially, you are more focused on what it can’t be rather than trying to guess what it is.This is a rule out.An ExampleWe had a problem at work that had occupied three developers over two days. The compiler was hanging and they couldn’t figure out why.It took me thirty minutes to solve it and come up with a solution.Not because I am all that, but because I knew the system well enough to start doing rule outs immediately.Everyone in this group was convinced up one way and down the other that it had something to do with Guice—a library we were using. They couldn’t figure out how, but they knew that this was the problem as the element in all of this that they had no experience with.I knew from the symptom—the compiler hanging—that it almost certainly couldn’t be Guice. Guice doesn’t affect the compiler and is largely downstream of the compiler. I devised a test to double check this case and hit the compiler hang without the guice annotations.Great.What else could it be?It&#39;s entering a task,so unlikely thatgradle proper is the causeIs it failing during execution or compilation? It seems to be during a`compileJava` step, so not a tool or a testHappening during some sort of `compileJava` stepA bug in javac is possible,but we aren&#39;t doing anythingtoo weird, so unlikelyIf it is a library we knowit has to be somethingthat changes or analyzes bytecodeWe can pull the test compilestep out entirely andit still happens, so not JaCoCoRemoving the static analyzer causesit to pass, we&#39;ve found our problemNow we can drill into specifics,which one is causing it?Build HangingXORGradleXORExecutionCompilationXORJavaLibraryXORJaCoCoStatic AnalyzerSpecific ChecksI know that the Java compiler has quirks, but is usually pretty solid and doesn’t randomly hang. So what is changing the compiler?I run the compiler and I note that we aren’t getting to the test phase, so it isn’t jacoco—a library that is frequently responsible for this sort of thing because it munges bytecode.We also have a static analysis tool running that runs its own version of the compiler as part of the compiler step?I disable the static analysis tool. Rerun it. No hanging. Culprit found. A little more diagnosis and I find the specific rule and fire a commit to disable it then file a bug with the team that handles the static analysis tool. I quickly do differential diagnosis and also determine how we can circumvent the problem in the meantime (it has to do with a final check, so we can either disable the final check or just… not trip the final value check).As the saying goes: You are paying for the 20 seconds of pushing the button and the 20 years of experience to know which button to push.The Core LoopThe process is essentially one of making rule outs: Identify the apparent error. Determine what it can’t be. Determine what it might be and start proving each one as Not the Problem, starting with the easiest ones and the ones that will clear the most possibilities. Goto 1.In any given situation with software a given error could be an almost (countably) infinite number of things. So being able to quickly prune entire trees and know how to test to rule out significant parts of the trees becomes a critical skill.Why This WorksWe have several biases as humans that work against us for debugging: We tend to view things as more likely culprits that we are less familiar with and tend to overestimate the likelihood of things based on recent events. This is a form of the availability heuristic. We tend to, on finding a possibility, try to find answers that confirm our hypothesis and reinforce our beliefs, rather than answers that eliminate the hypothesis. This is a form of confirmation bias. We tend to look mostly to the tools we know in order to diagnose and fix the problem, which is a form of anchoring bias.Performing rule outs is a way of breaking these (and other, related) biases. It forces our brain to consider alternatives and, by considering the alternatives, allows us to more quickly eliminate possibilities and narrow down on an answer.Basically: Before we can accept something as true, we must first/also prove that other possibilities are false.Another Illustrative ExampleA while back I was working with an intern who had been banging their head on a problem for about half a day. They were getting an error when passing a file to a parser. It looked basically like this:LibraryYAMLOpenAPI ParserJSON ParserOur CodeThey had a error where it wasn’t working. So they jumped to the piece they were least familiar with: the internal library.They started setting breakpoints inside of the third party library. Started evaluating the source code and trying to read it. They found not just the error coming out of it, but the error inside of the system that was leading to it. They were hypothesizing if the fact that it was a YAML file but the parser seemed to be geared for JSON mattered.All questions you need to be able to ask. Eventually.Instead, we start with the error: An illegal argument exception that is caused by some sort of parsing error. It’s coming from a shallow place in the code too.Then my brain immediately went to the possibilities: It can be that the parser itself has a bug, but since it’s a pretty solid and stable parser that seems unlikely. We can validate this is the case later by directly passing in the file if all else fails. It could be a bug in the interface between their tooling and the library, e.g., calling the wrong method, needing a flag to be set, or asking it for an object type it doesn’t know how to work with. It could be a problem with what they are giving the library. Either because it is not being properly loaded or because it isn’t in a format that the library expects.Known good file,so it should parseWe can dig intothis if necessaryWhat we arepassing in is emptyFile comes fromlibrary, known goodExceptionParser BugInterface BugInput BugFile NotBeing LoadedBad FileConfirm: They got the file from the library. This is one of their example files. It’s a known-good file. So it isn’t the second half of (3). This also gives us some confidence that it isn’t (1) (Core Loop Step 2).Okay, so how can I rule out that it is a problem with what’s being passed to the library? (Core Loop Step 3) Let’s load it out and print it as a first step. This will tell us if what is being passed in is what we expect.Tada. Found the problem.The contents of the file weren’t being loaded into the object, so an empty file was being passed along. The parser didn’t know what to make of that and couldn’t figure out how to fit it into the object type it was being asked to work with, so it was dying.ConclusionThis is a difficult skill that takes practice and time, but it has helped me tremendously in my career. It’s a systematic approach to problem solving that I’ve personally found useful and that people who I’ve taught it to also seem to have found useful." }, { "title": "Setting up a Blog", "url": "/categories/technology/web/posts/configuring-jekyll", "categories": "technology, web", "tags": "jekyll, github, gitpod", "date": "2022-04-08 06:54:19 -0600", "snippet": "What I wanted: The ability to typeset mathematics.

Virtually none were set up for modern versions of MathJax.So my first pass was to do it in the most complicated way possible: Why not just use latex directly in a prebuilt container on gitpod?I loaded up the guide from 2019 and the guide for getting started with github pages, built a docker container, and we’re good to go, right?i learned to code by writing html in notepad and dragging the file into an FTP client. I wouldn&amp;#39;t even know where to start today. https://t.co/MxQgOUzChE&amp;mdash; Owen Williams ⚡ (@ow) May 1, 2020Timeouts, Compile Errors, and Typos oh myTurns out that downloading texlive-full requires downloading about two thirds of the internet and that gitpod really doesn’t like prebuilds taking over an hour. So that’s exciting and also difficult to debug, because it doesn’t come out and tell you that like a good process, it just kind of lets you infer it. Especially if you want to download anything after that, things can get pretty exciting.It also turns out that ruby versions matter for compiling and that there were a variety of path weirdness from me not quite understanding how to execute the ruby code within gitpod as part of a dockerfile. Suffice it to say just doing this:RUN gem install bundler…did not do what I wanted nor expected.Gitpod, for its part, was mostly generating errors that looked like this:Prebuild failed for system reasons. Please contact support. Error: headless task failed: exit status 1With no real tangible logs to speak of to let me know what happened, and things often getting conflated with what looks like the timeout.My first instinct, of course, is that I need to install ruby, so I give that a shot:RUN brew install rubyThis has two main effects: It makes the build take longer, further exacerbating the timeout. It does not, in fact, solve my problem with bundler.Eventually I give up and go “I’ll find some other way to manage it temporarily” and pull out all of the $\\LaTeX$ pieces, since those seem to be obscuring anything else going on. “I’ll just get this set up with jekyll first, and then I’ll circle back to $\\LaTeX$ if necessary,” I think.Now having solved my timeout issue, it’s easier to debug my ruby problems—it can’t find gem—and I find someone else’s solution to that:FROM gitpod/workspace-fullRUN echo &quot;rvm_gems_path=/home/gitpod/.rvm&quot; &amp;gt; ~/.rvmrcUSER gitpodRUN /bin/bash -l -c &quot;gem install jekyll&quot;RUN /bin/bash -l -c &quot;gem install bundler&quot;Okay, that works. If that didn’t work I’ve also seen people put the gem commands into a gitpod init, which also seems to work okay.Now I can go and initialize the repository.I quickly get it set up and running with the midnight theme, which looks pretty at first glance and we’re off to the races.Except going the wrong directionA few things become quickly apparent: Github pages depends on an old (ancient?) version of jekyll and doesn’t look like it will… ever… get updated. The list of supported plugins is very short. Midnight is an awfully… bare bones… theme. It doesn’t really support my use case without significant customization. It only has a default template, and that’s pretty minimalistic. It doesn’t even support the initial generated file types.Hunting around for this I find a lot of people really like jekyll-spaceship and it does pretty much everything I need… and it is not going to get allowlisted any time soon. I first find this by trying to compile:\\vdash \\frac{1}{2}Which it renders for me as $\\vdash \\frac{1}{2}$ on my local system but on pages just shows up as source code on an unthemed page.But there is a solution to this: Because jekyll is just a static page generator, we can run it as part of a github action. That way we’ll generate it when pushing to main.Perfect.Gang aft agleyTurns out there is a conflict between the github pages plugin and the version of jekyll I want to use. No big deal, I’ll just pull the information out of the system and…Wait, what do you mean all of my text is now completely without a template?I try various things to circumvent this problem—including using the remote template plugin and downloading it locally—but it turns out that this is a consequence of two things: The presence of the plugins jekyll-default-layout and jekyll-optional-front-matter. These were probably done to make life easier for beginners setting up sites, but what it meant in practice was that not all of the (generated! dowloaded!) files actually had any template information associated with them, and in some cases just flat out failed to do anything productive. Because the template only has default as a base, it doesn’t include… post, or home, or, well, anything.While (1) is an easy fix (just add the information), there seems to be no way around (2) with this template short of writing everything from the ground up.But it is enough to get the github action working. This takes a few false starts due to some confusion about branches, but it was actually remarkably straightforward to set up. Good job to the creator of the action and to the github actions team.The hunt begins for a themeOkay, so next stop is to find a template that will… actually… work. The theme world is a horrid mess and while pages like Jekyll Themes exist they lack really any sort of search functionality adequate to find what I am looking for.So I find one that seems to look reasonable, eventually, plug it in and……what do you mean there are more files that I need?So it turns out that while a good chunk of the theme is in the gem, there’s also a good bit in a default project that they have to jump start things.There is no easy way, with jekyll, to bring down the files that I can find. People are recommending strategies like bringing down everything into a clean detached branch and fixing a bunch of merge conflicts.I solve this by copying it over and copying the files more-or-less by hand, which isn’t too bad given the new project state.That works reasonably well, so I do a bit of mucking around with the configuration—adding CDNs or changing which CDN was used, altering a few versions, tweaking the fonts, etc.Things look good—I can now compile things like $\\frac{x:{\\mathbf T} \\in \\Gamma}{\\Gamma \\vdash x:T}$, so I deploy and call it a day.I have abandoned installing jekyll and am now making a geocities website&amp;mdash; zachary (@chetchavat) February 15, 2019" }, { "title": "First Post", "url": "/categories/meta/admin/posts/first-post", "categories": "meta, admin", "tags": "first-post", "date": "2022-04-07 12:19:19 -0600", "snippet": "A place for assorted thoughtsI have been running into the challenge recently of wanting to write out various notes and experiences and finding that twitter is the wrong format, Facebook has rapidly become more unusable for writing, medium seemed like the wrong venue for a few different reasons, and I really wanted somewhere I could jot down things.I’ve run more specialized blogs before that were focused on a wide variety of things over the years, some of which were moderately successful by whatever metric, but really fundamentally I grew bored or something came up.So that’s what this blog is an answer to.
