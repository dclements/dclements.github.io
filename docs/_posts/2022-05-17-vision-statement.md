From the "Visions and Goals" section of the "Planning for a Sustainable Property" handout.

## Vision for the Land in Five to Ten Years

We have a property that is well suited for therapy with human-equine interactions. A quiet, peaceful space that emphasizes the natural environment and the features of the land. We keep between six and ten horses (including some minis) on the property along with chickens and the occasional rented goat.  They live in a paddock track system and stay in turnout most days, but there is a barn for horses that don't thrive in that environment or who have specialized needs for feeding, grooming, or other care.  There's good pasture that we can use for enrichment and views but not grazing.

## Long Term Goals and Short Term Actions

### Sustainable Planting

Building and maintaining a good pasture, free of noxious weeds.

1. Seeding twice a year with area-appropriate seeds.
2. Plant roses along the edge of the property and around a labyrinth.
3. Put natives up around the house and back yard.
4. Minimize bare soil.

### Water

1. Store manure well away from the local water supply (manure management plan).
2. Ensure that herbicides are appropriate and safe for the area.

### Animals

1. Find suitable shelter for moving more animals to property.
2. Research options for dead animal disposal and make sure the numbers are posted along with vet and farrier information.
3. Build manure management plan.
