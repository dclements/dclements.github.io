## A place for assorted thoughts

I have been running into the challenge recently of wanting to write out various notes and experiences and finding that twitter is the wrong format, Facebook has rapidly become more unusable for writing, medium seemed like the wrong venue for a few different reasons, and I really wanted somewhere I could jot down things.

I've run more specialized blogs before that were focused on a wide variety of things over the years, some of which were moderately successful by whatever metric, but really fundamentally I grew bored or something came up.

So that's what this blog is an answer to. I don't know who will read this or if anyone will read this, how often I will or will not post, and maybe this is just me screaming into the void, but that's okay.

Sometimes the void needs screaming into.
